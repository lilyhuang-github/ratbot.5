# Rat discord bot

This was made by me to understand how the Discord API works/API's in general and to get experiencce on making a program for a more real world type thing. Also uses a Bing Images library and also a website for replit to keep it alive.

It's a bot the replies a rat image to user.

Utilises some code to keep it running using replit: https://ratbot5.lilyhao.repl.co

Doesn't have my discord token, you need to add it.
